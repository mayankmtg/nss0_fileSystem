Any file name has a single '.'
Directory names cannot have any '.'
If a user does not exits then the server prompts for the creation of a new one

Each of the user's username has to be unique (thus avoiding the use of userID).

No file or directory can have names ending with '.m' or '.d'

Arguments cannot have size more than 294

ls takes exactly one argument (the directory path absolute or relative)
ls command runs on directory without read permissions (listing can be done.)
/ and simple_home have group name associated with all which allows all users to read the directory


Check for extra spaces and tabs in the input from client and remove them

cd to a directory if we have read permissions

fput quit from file input output using 'Q\n'
fput to directory only when we have write permissions
fput to a new file takes owner and group first time and no other time
fput to a new file takes input from the user creating the file regardless of the owner of the file.
